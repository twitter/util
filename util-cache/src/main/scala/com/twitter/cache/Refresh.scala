/**
 * A single-value asynchronous cache with TTL.  The provider supplies the future value when invoked
 * and this class ensures that the provider is not invoked more frequently than the TTL.  If the
 * future fails, that failure is not cached. If more than one value is required, a FutureCache
 * backed by a `Caffeine` cache with TTL may be more appropriate.
 *
 * This is useful in situations where a call to an external service returns a value that changes
 * infrequently and we need to access that value often, for example asking a service for a list of
 * features that it supports.
 *
 * A non-memoized function like this:
 *   def getData(): Future[T] = { ... }
 *
 * can be memoized with a TTL of 1 hour as follows:
 *   import com.twitter.util.TimeConversions._
 *   import com.twitter.cache.Refresh
 *   val getData: () => Future[T] = Refresh.every(1.hour) { ... }

   *       ...

   * @return A memoized version of `operation` that will refresh on invocation
