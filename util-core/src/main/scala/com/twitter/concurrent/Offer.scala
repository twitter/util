/**
 * An offer to communicate with another process. The offer is
 * parameterized on the type of the value communicated. An offer that
 * sends a value typically has type {{Unit}}. An offer is activated by
 * synchronizing it, which is done with `sync()`.
 *
 * Note that Offers are persistent values -- they may be synchronized
 * multiple times. They represent a standing offer of communication, not
 * a one-shot event.
 *
 * =The synchronization protocol=
 *
 * Synchronization is performed via a two-phase commit process.
 * `prepare()` commenses the transaction, and when the other party is
 * ready, it returns with a transaction object, `Tx[T]`. This must then
 * be ackd or nackd. If both parties acknowledge, `Tx.ack()` returns
 * with a commit object, containing the value. This finalizes the
 * transaction. Please see the `Tx` documentation for more details on
 * that phase of the protocol.
 *
 * Note that a user should never perform this protocol themselves --
 * synchronization should always be done with `sync()`.
 *
 * Future cancellation is propagated, and failure is passed through. It
 * is up to the implementor of the Offer to decide on failure semantics,
 * but they are always passed through in all of the combinators.
