 * dependencies.  This means that Locals have exactly the same semantics as
 * ThreadLocals, if you think of `continue` (the asynchronous sequence operator)
 * as semicolon (the synchronous sequence operator).
 *
 * Because it's not meaningful to inherit control from two places, Locals don't
 * have to worry about having to merge two [[com.twitter.util.Local.Context Contexts]].
 *
 * Note: the implementation is optimized for situations in which save and
 * restore optimizations are dominant.
