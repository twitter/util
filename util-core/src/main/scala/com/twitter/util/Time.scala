 * between two points in time, while `Time` measure the number of
 * nanoseconds since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC).
 *
 * TimeLike behave like '''boxed''' java Double values with respect
 * to infinity and undefined values. In particular, this means that a

 * turn this means it can be used as keys in maps, etc.
