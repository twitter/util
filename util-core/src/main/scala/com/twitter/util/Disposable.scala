/**
 * ==Resource Management==
 *
 * [[com.twitter.util.Disposable]] represents a live resource that must be disposed after use.
 * [[com.twitter.util.Managed]] is a factory for creating and composing such resources.
 * Managed resources are composed together so their lifetimes are synchronized.
 *
 * The following example shows how to build and use composite managed resources:
 *
 * {{{
 * // Create managed Tracer
 * def mkManagedTracer() = new Managed[Tracer] {
 *   def make() = new Disposable[Tracer] {
 *     val underlying = new Tracer()
 *     def get = underlying
 *     def dispose(deadline: Time) = underlying.close() // assumes Tracer uses relese() to manage lifetime
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Create managed Server using Tracer as dependency
 * def mkManagedServer(t: Tracer) = new Managed[Server] {
 *   def make() = new Disposable[Server] {
 *     val underlying = new Server(t) // Server requires tracer to be created
 *     def get = underlying
 *     def dispose(deadline: Time) = underlying.close() // assumes Server uses close() to manage lifetime
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Create composite resource
 * val compRes: Managed[Server] = for {
 *   a <- mkManagedTracer()
 *   b <- mkManagedServer(a)
 * } yield b
 *
 * // Use composite resource in safe fashion. It's guaranteed that both resources
 * // will be properly closed/released when done using them.
 * compRes foreach { b =>
 *   // use b (which is type Server in this case)
 * } // dispose called on both resources
 * }}}
 *
 * =Disposable/Managed Semantics=
 *
 * [[com.twitter.util.Disposable]]: get can be called multiple times and should return same instance;
 * dispose can be called only once and should release resource that get is returning;
 * calling get after dispose is undefined.
 *
 * [[com.twitter.util.Managed]]: multiple calls to make could return
 *  a) new instance or
 *  b) ref counted instance of the underlying resource or
 *  c) same instance when resource doesn't need to be actually disposed, etc.
 *
 * Disposable is a container for a resource that must be explicitly disposed when
 * no longer needed. After this, the resource is no longer available.
