/**
 * A composable application trait that includes flag parsing as well
 * as basic application lifecycle (pre- and post- main). Flag parsing
 * is done via [[com.twitter.app.Flags]], an instance of which is
 * defined in the member `flag`. Applications should be constructed
 * with modularity in mind, and common functionality should be
 * extracted into mixins.
 *
 * Flags should only be constructed in the constructor, and should only be read
 * in the premain or later, after they have been parsed.
 *
 * {{{
 * object MyApp extends App {
 *   val n = flag("n", 100, "Number of items to process")
 *
 *   def main() {
 *     for (i <- 0 until n()) process(i)
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * Note that a missing `main` is OK: mixins may provide behavior that
 * does not require defining a custom `main` method.
